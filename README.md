# Taxi-Driving-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
This is a modified environment from Open AI gym v3. It simulates a simplified taxi environment, the goal is to teach a taxi agent to be to pick up and drop off passenger to their destination with the least possible number of moves and while avoiding roadblocks(walls). The simplified environment is broken into a 5x5 Grid and contains roadblocks(walls). The taxi is the only vehicle in this environment. There are 4 possible locations where passengers can be picked up or dropped off, these are labelled as R(ed), G(reen), Y(ellow), B(lue). The agent's task is to pick up a passenger from one of these locations and drop the passenger at another location
